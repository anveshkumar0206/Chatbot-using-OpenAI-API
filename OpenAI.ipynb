By utilizing data mining and predictive modeling techniques on NHIS data, the research uncovered various patterns and associations. Key discoveries encompassed an increase in asthma attack rates over time, the interconnection between asthma and chronic illnesses, the distribution of asthma severity levels, and insights into the health repercussions. The results notably indicated a noteworthy link between asthma severity and heart conditions, underscoring the necessity for targeted interventions and early detection approaches. The findings offer valuable insights for healthcare providers to identify high-risk asthma patients, diminish emergency visits, and elevate patient outcomes, thereby improving the quality of life. The study underscores the significance of holistic healthcare strategies dealing with asthma and its coexisting conditions, contributing to a deeper comprehension of asthma intricacies which can steer effective healthcare planning and resource allotment. Consequently, through this research, healthcare professionals can enhance patient care and tailor interventions for vulnerable populations, thus improving health outcomes and curbing healthcare expenses.\n",
