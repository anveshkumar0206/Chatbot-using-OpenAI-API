# Chatbot-using-OpenAI-API-Document-Processing

Project Overview

1. This project utilizes the OpenAI API to build a chatbot capable of performing various tasks, including:
Solving complex math problems through iterative chatbot interactions. 
2. Processing and summarizing PDF and website content, including rewriting and answering queries based on the provided documents.
3. Summarizing chat interactions to enhance user engagement and provide structured responses.

Installation: 
Before running the notebook, ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed:
Python 3.x
OpenAI API Key
Required libraries such as openai, PyMuPDF (for PDF processing), and requests (for web content fetching).

OpenAI API Key Setup:

Get an API key from OpenAI.
Store the API key securely (e.g., using environment variables).
Load the API key in the notebook before making API requests.

Features: 

1. Chatbot for Solving Complex Math Problems
Uses OpenAI's model to solve and explain mathematical problems iteratively.

2. PDF & Website Content Processing
i. Extracts text from PDF files and website content.
ii. Allows users to ask questions about the extracted content.
iii. Provides rewritten summaries and explanations.

Chat Summarization: 
Generates a structured summary of the chat conversation, making it easier to review key insights.

Usage: 

i. Run the Jupyter Notebook and follow the prompts.
ii. Provide a math problem and get step-by-step explanations.
iii. Upload a PDF or provide a website URL to extract and summarize content.
iv. Ask the chatbot questions related to the document.
v. Receive a final chat summary at the end of the session.
